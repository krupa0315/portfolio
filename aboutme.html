  <h1><b>It's Me!</b></h1>
  <p>Hey, I am Krupa Patel. I am 17 years old and currently a senior at Galileo High School. I love to listen to 
   music and I also like to dance a lot. I do dislike learning history and some sciences such as Chemistry or 
    Physics.I love biology and I have no idea what I want to do in the future. I love chocolate. I love it when 
    people do sweet little gestures for me whether it be opening a door or just saying hello. A fun fact, I actually
    really like math eventhough most people think I hate it and since math is such a popularly hated subject.</p>
