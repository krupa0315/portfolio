  <h1><b>WebFramework Django 7/5/17</b><h1/>
   <p>We first learned about the differences from MVC and webframework. MVC is a method/design pattern to relate the user interface to underlyying data model. It is used in programming, building a webpage. While WebFramework have web coding which stores copies of docs and different programming techniques such as URL mapping. The difference between framework and library is that when you call a method from a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted which means the framework controls you. A framework contains a library.<p/>
  <p2>Another thing we did is learn about MVC and MTV. MVC is a model view controller. Model is a representation of your data, view is what you see on the site/computer, and controller is what controls the flow of information between the model and the view. While MTV is a model template view. In this case, model is used for the data access layer which is everything about the data, a template is how things would be displayed on the webpage, and view in this case is the bridge between the model and the template.</p2>
