  <h1><b>WebFramework Django 7/5/17</b><h1/>
   <p>We first learned about the differences from MVC and webframework. MVC is a method/design pattern to relate the user interface to underlyying data model. It is used in programming, building a webpage. While WebFramework have web coding which stores copies of docs and different programming techniques such as URL mapping. The difference between framework and library is that when you call a method from a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted which means the framework controls you. A framework contains a library.<p/>
  <p2>Another thing we did is learn about MVC and MTV. MVC is a model view controller. Model is a representation of your data, view is what you see on the site/computer, and controller is what controls the flow of information between the model and the view. While MTV is a model template view. In this case, model is used for the data access layer which is everything about the data, a template is how things would be displayed on the webpage, and view in this case is the bridge between the model and the template.</p2>
  <p3>DJANGO DAY DJANGO DAY. Right now I just created the page and started to customize it. I wish I could do a lot more and be able to show colors and some different types of fonts. There are more things and more fonts I want to do. I could create sites with makeup because I love makeup. 

    <h1><b>Algorithms</b></h2>
    <p> When i first learned about algorithms, I realized we see a lot of in our day to day lives. Like the one I learned showed privacy and there are always people who try to hack your accounts and it is best to learn how they all actually work. I think the most interesting yet simple algorithm to me is the long division. It is something we all know, but I never knew it had in tie with techonology. It was interesting to see how math played a part of this. The algorithms today seemed alot more simplier yet probably more complex than Alicia Abella because she discovered it a long time ago and ever since then, it has become more complicated and harder and complex. </p>
    <h1><b>OOP; Object Orient Project</b></h1>
    <p> This is very complicated. I felt kind of completely lost while doing the project today. I did learn about class and instances and inheritances today. It was pretty cool. I compared it. </p>
